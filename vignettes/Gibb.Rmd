An assumption made by Hujoel et al.(2020) is that the liabilities of subjects and families follow a multivariate normal distribution (See vignette LTFH). With this assumption liabilities of each family member can be estimated if their phenotypes are provided. 

These liabilitites are estimated using Monte Carlo integration. In genstats a Gibb sampler has been implemented, by sampling from a conditional distribution for each liability estimates are obtained iteratively. The obtained phenotypes of family members can be implemented in the model by sampling from a truncated normal distribution.
To clarify if a family member is a case we know that the liability of the family member is above a threshold T, given a prevalence K. To sample from a a truncated normal distribution we sample a value from one of the two intervals shown below.
$$
T = \Phi^{-1}(1-K) \\
L_p \sim N(\mu_p, \sigma_p) \\
\Downarrow
\\
P(L_p \leq T) = F_{L_p}(T) \\
\Downarrow
\\
\text{if p is case}: P(L_p = l_p) \in [F_{l_p}(T) , 1 ]\\
\text{else}: P(L_p =l_p) \in [0, F_{l_p}(T)] \\
$$
Now we sample a value $p_{lp}$ uniformly from one of the two intervals given the family members case. To get a sample for $l_p$ we set $l_p = F_{L_p}^{-1}(p_{lp})$
